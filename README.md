# Keystats Collector
Store keystrokes count in a file.

The point is that want to know which keys I type the most, to draw conclusions
about which kind of keyboard I should have and what layout would be useful or
not.

This is an attempt at making something that will keep count in a JSON file in
your home directory. And it's an app so you can see when it's active.

Then the plan is to visualize the contents of that JSON file using something
like this:
* https://github.com/pa7/Keyboard-Heatmap
* https://github.com/mayoff/keyscope
